Nodes has 4 features an Asynchronous, Non-Blocking , Multi-threaded, Event Driven

Even though Node js is multi-threaded javascript can do only task at a time meaning javascript is Single-threaded.
Node can be multi threaded by having c++ implementations allowing to have multiple threads unlike javascript.

Node can run multiple threads by incorporating

1. Call Stack (A data structure where functions will executed like main(), event functions(), etc)
2. Node API's (functions/events which take long to execute will be pushed to Node API this is C++ implemented meaning functions/events which javascript can't execute)
3. Callback Queue (once timer is done in previous step / fetching is done it will queued to callback queue)
4. Event Loop (event loop runs only when call stack is empty meaning it will execute only if main function is executed and the stack is empty)
